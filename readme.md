# Swift News Jam!

## Getting Started
The idea behind this app was to provide the SwiftUI community a single app to curate the numerous RSS feeds that have been provided to us via our community members blog sites. The app was built as a submission piece for the [2021 Fall SwiftUI Jam](https://swiftuijam.com) - here's to hoping for an award!

## What can it do?
Right now our goal minimum viable product (MVP) is to simply show the RSS feed in a readable format from the one, the only [John Sundell](https://swiftbysundell).

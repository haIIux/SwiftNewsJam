# Swift News Jam!

## Getting Started
The idea behind this app was to provide the SwiftUI community a single app to curate the numerous RSS feeds that have been provided to us via our community members blog sites. The app was built as a submission piece for the [2021 Fall SwiftUI Jam](https://swiftuijam.com) - here's to hoping for an award! Swift News Jam uses [The Composable Architecture by PointFree](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture). 

An alternative SwiftUI state management for something a little more barebones compared to TCA which is worth checking out, would be [CacheStore by 0xOpenBytes](https://github.com/0xOpenBytes/CacheStore).

## What can it do?
Right now our goal minimum viable product (MVP) is to simply show the RSS feed in a readable format from the one, the only [John Sundell](https://swiftbysundell).
